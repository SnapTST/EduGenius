## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft lavender (#D0B8FF) to evoke a sense of calm and intellectual stimulation. Its gentle hue helps create a focused learning environment.
- Background color: Light off-white (#FAF9FF), a subtle tint that provides a clean and distraction-free backdrop. This ensures that the content remains the focal point.
- Accent color: Muted teal (#70A1AF) to highlight key interactive elements. Its contrast against the lavender and off-white makes it easily noticeable.
- Headline font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for a contemporary and precise feel, lending an air of crispness to headers.
- Body font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for readability, and it pairs well with Poppins to create an easily approachable design.
- Implement a clean, grid-based layout to present educational content clearly and logically. Use white space effectively to avoid clutter and improve readability.
- Incorporate subtle, non-distracting animations (e.g., a smooth transition when displaying new test questions). Such animations offer positive feedback without pulling focus from the content.
